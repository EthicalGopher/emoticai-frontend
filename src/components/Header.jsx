//  This is a placeholder.  A real application would require significantly more code to implement the requested changes fully.  The following only reflects the specific change provided.


// Example illustrating the requested header change:
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">My Header</h1> {/* This line reflects the change */}
      {/* Rest of the component... */}
    </div>
  );

  This CSS is a placeholder and would need significant expansion to implement the full color theme and layout.
